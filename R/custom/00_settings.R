# ---- Topics Settings ----
# The dashboard is designed to show tweets related to a conference, using
# specific terms to locate conference tweets. If the conference tweets are part
# of a broader Twitter community, you can also show stats about the full
# community (see also `topic_icon_full` above).
#
# Note that currently, this app expects tweet gathering to be conducted by an
# external script or process. The terms below should then match or extend the
# terms used in the gathering process.
#
# See https://github.com/gadenbuie/gathertweet for a utility for tweet
# gathering.

  # Note that these are used internally and are compared with the lowercase
  # tweet text (so that case doesn't matter). Terms are evaluated invidividually
  # using str_detect(tweet_text, term), so you may use regular expressions. A
  # tweet is considered "topical" if _any_ term matches.

# ---- Tweet Storage Location ----
